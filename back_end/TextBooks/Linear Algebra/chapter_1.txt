text: One common use of matries is to represent systems of linear equations. The matrix derived form the system of linear equations is the augmented matrix of the system. The matrix containing only the coefficient is called the cofficient matrix of the system

text: Elementary Row operations: an elementary row operation on an augmented matrix produces a new augmented matrix which corrosponds to a new but equivalent system of linear equations. Two matrices are row equivalent when one can be obtained from the other by a finite sequence of elementary row operations.

text: The three elementary row operations: - An interchange of two rows "row swap" - Multiply a row by a non-zero constant - Add a multiple of a row to another row
class: definition
format: plain

text: These operations are simple to perform, however, they require frequent arithmatic which is prone to have simple mistakes, noteing these operations can help verify or correct errors when a solution is incorrect.
